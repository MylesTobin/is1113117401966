            <div class="section" id="section1">Cloud computing is an information technology (IT) paradigm whereby information is stored in an online server, rather than on a computer's own harddrive.<br>
            While the term "cloud computing" was popularized with Amazon.com releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006, references to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.<br>
            Cloud Computing is a very useful service in our current age of technology

        	<div class="section" id="section2">Cloud computing is useful for us as students as it allows us to store projects, essays and other such forms of information easily.<br>
        	As BIS students we are involved in a lot of computer based projects that we can store easily, without filling a computer's memory due to the cloud.<br>
        	This is a very useful service.
        	</div>
        	
        	<div class="section" id="section3">Cloud Computing is also very important in businesses today.<br>
        	Businesses store a lot of information. To store this on a computer would cost a great amount. However the emergence of the cloud has allowed businesses to store their data online,
        	greatly reducing the cost of storing data. As such, the cloud is a great asset to businesses.
