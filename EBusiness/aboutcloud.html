    <p>Cloud computing is defined as the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.<br>
    In other words, this means storing data online rather than in the computer's own memory.<br>
    Cloud computing is useful for a number of different services that we provide:<br><br></p>
    <p>Software as a Service:Salesforce<br>
     Salesforce.com, Inc. is an American cloud computing company headquartered in San Francisco, California. <br>
                 Though its revenue comes from a customer relationship management (CRM) product, Salesforce also sells commercial applications of social networking through acquisition and internal development.<br>
                 Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories:<br>
                 Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud, App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.<br><br>

        	<p>Communication as a Service:Gmail<br>
        	Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google.<br>
        	Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004, and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.<br>
            The idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name Caribou.<br>
            During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project became better and better, and by early 2004, almost everybody was using it to access the company's internal email system.<br><br>
